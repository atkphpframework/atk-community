/**
 * The atkRecycleBin is a generic recycle bin for records. You can add it 
 * to any node and if a record from that node will get deleted,
 * atkRecycleBin will kick in and transfer the record to the recyclebin.
 * 
 * There are 2 modes of operation. You can build your own recyclebin node,
 * and atkRecycleBin will use that to store the deleted record.
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can skip creating a node, and just create a table
 * that is identical to the one you're deleting records from. 
 * If you don't specify this table, atkRecycleBin will assume that
 * the table is called tablename_bin, where tablename is the tablename
 * from the node you're deleting records from. 
 * 
 * Usage: $node->addListener(new atkRecycleBin());
 * 
 * @todo a third mode of operation might be one serialized recyclebin
 * for all the tables in the application.
