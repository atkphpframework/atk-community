Module specific configuration files can be placed in this directory.

They should have the following naming convention:

<modulename>.inc.php

    The contents of each file should look like:

    <?php
    $config["key"] = "value";
    ?>

    Values can be retrieved using:

    $value = atkConfig::get("modname", "key", "defaultvalue");

    atkConfig takes care of including the file when it needs to.

    (Keys do not need to be globally unique, only unique at the module level; $config["foo"] 
    in two different .inc.php files is supported.)
